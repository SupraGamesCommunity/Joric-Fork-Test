## How to Use & Documentation

### Map linking URL

The current map can be found here:
- [https://supragamescommunity.github.io/maps](https://supragamescommunity.github.io/maps)

In addition you can share a link to a specific map, zoom level and position:  
`https://supragamescommunity.github.io/maps/#mapId={map}&lat={lat}&lng={lng}&zoom={zoom}`
- `mapId` = one of {sl / slc / siu}.
- `zoom` is 0-4 where 0 is all the way zoomed out.
- `lat/lng` are the X Y position on the map.

## Assets and Dependencies

FModel did not work for large maps, Joric ended up using [UE4Parse](https://github.com/MinshuG/pyUE4Parse), a wonderful Python library by [MountainFlash](https://github.com/MinshuG/).
