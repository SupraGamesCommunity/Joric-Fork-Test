This is an experimental 2d/3d map, made with [Maptalks](https://maptalks.org).

## Issues

* Parallax effect in 2d mode (when pitch is zero)
* Double lines with compound markers when drawAltitude is enabled
* sortByDistanceToCamera doesn't work across layers, need all markers in a single layer
